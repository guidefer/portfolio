# Navigation Timing & Mascot Animation Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Navigation Appearing Too Early
**Problem**: Navigation was appearing 2 seconds before the loading screen fully faded out.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced delayed timeout with precise `transitionend` event listener
- Navigation now triggers immediately when loading screen opacity transition completes
- Added console logging to track exact timing

**Code Changes**:
- `loading.js`: Used `transitionend` event instead of fixed 1000ms timeout
- Removed extra delays that were causing early appearance
- Added immediate navigation trigger when fade completes

### 2. Mascot Popping In/Out/In Animation Conflicts
**Problem**: Mascot had conflicting animations (transitions + keyframe animations) causing multiple entrances.

**Solution**:
- Simplified to single clean entrance animation only
- Added `entrance-complete` class to mark when entrance is done
- Blocked all state changes until entrance completes
- Prevented auto-cycling during entrance

**Code Changes**:
- `mascot-unified.css`: 
  - Removed conflicting transition properties
  - Single `mascotEntrance` keyframe animation with 0.8s delay
  - Added `entrance-complete` state for post-entrance behavior
  - Used `!important` to override any conflicting styles during loading

- `mascot-unified.js`:
  - Added `animationend` listener for entrance completion
  - Blocked `setState()` calls during loading and entrance
  - Blocked auto-cycling until entrance completes
  - Set initial state to `idle` (CSS handles entrance)

## New Timing Sequence:

1. **Loading Screen**: 3+ seconds with cherry blossoms
2. **Fade Out**: 1 second transition with precise event detection
3. **Navigation**: Appears immediately when fade completes (no delay)
4. **Mascot**: Starts entrance animation 0.8s after navigation (after nav completes)
5. **Mascot Complete**: 1.5s entrance animation, then normal behavior starts

## Key Improvements:

- **Precise Timing**: `transitionend` event ensures perfect synchronization
- **No Conflicts**: Single animation pathway for mascot entrance
- **Clean States**: Clear separation between loading, entrance, and normal states
- **Better Logging**: Console messages show exact timing for debugging
- **Fallback Safety**: Timeout fallback in case events don't fire

The navigation should now appear exactly when the loading screen finishes fading, and the mascot should have a single, clean entrance without any popping or multiple animations.
