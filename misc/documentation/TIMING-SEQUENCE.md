# Cherry Blossom Loading Sequence - Timing Guide

## Current Timing Sequence (All times in milliseconds)

### Phase 1: Loading Screen (3000ms minimum)
- **0ms**: Loading screen appears with cherry blossoms
- **0-3000ms**: Asset loading + progress simulation
- **2200-3000ms**: Loading bar reaches 100%
- **3000ms**: Loading completion requested

### Phase 2: Loading Screen Exit (1000ms)
- **3000ms**: Loading screen fade out begins (`loading-fade-out` class added)
- **3000-4000ms**: Loading screen fades out (CSS transition: 1s ease-out)
- **4000ms**: Loading screen `transitionend` event fires
- **4000ms**: Loading screen removed from DOM, z-index dropped to -1

### Phase 3: Navigation Entrance (800ms)
- **4100ms**: Body classes changed (`loading` removed, `loading-complete` added)
- **4100ms**: Navigation slide-down animation begins (`slideDownFromTop`)
- **4100-4900ms**: Navigation slides down (0.8s animation)
- **4900ms**: Navigation animation complete, z-index reset

### Phase 4: Mascot Entrance (1200ms)
- **4900ms**: Mascot entrance delay begins (0.8s after `loading-complete`)
- **4900-6100ms**: Mascot bouncy entrance animation
- **6100ms**: All entrance animations complete

## Total Sequence Duration: ~6.1 seconds

## Key Improvements Made:

1. **Precise Timing**: Using `transitionend` event instead of fixed timeout
2. **No Overlap**: Navigation only appears after loading screen is completely gone
3. **Sequential Animation**: Mascot waits for navigation to complete
4. **Smooth Transitions**: No flickering or z-index conflicts
5. **Console Logging**: Clear timing markers for debugging

## Expected User Experience:

1. Beautiful cherry blossom loading screen (enjoyable, not rushed)
2. Smooth fade out with no early navigation appearance
3. Elegant navigation slide-down after loading is completely gone
4. Delightful mascot bounce-in after navigation is settled
5. Seamless transition to interactive portfolio

The navigation should now appear exactly when the loading screen is fully faded out, with no overlap or early appearance.
