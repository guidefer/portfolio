# Background Petals Issue - Root Cause Found and Fixed

## Root Cause Discovery ✅
The background petals weren't showing because:

1. **CSS State Management**: The petals are controlled by loading state classes in `main.css`
2. **Opacity Control**: During `.loading` state, petals have `opacity: 0` (hidden)
3. **Delayed Reveal**: Only when `.loading-complete` class is applied do petals become visible
4. **Low Visibility**: Original opacity was only `0.6` making them barely visible

## Key CSS Rules Found
```css
/* In main.css */
.loading .bg-petals-container {
  opacity: 0;  /* Hidden during loading */
}

.loading-complete .bg-petals-container {
  opacity: 0.6;  /* Was too low - increased to 1 */
  transition: opacity 1.2s ease-out 0.8s;
}
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Increased Container Opacity
- Changed from `opacity: 0.6` to `opacity: 1` in `.loading-complete` state
- Added fallback rule for container visibility

### 2. Enhanced Individual Petal Visibility
- Increased petal size from 6px to 8px
- Changed color from `#ccc` to `#999` (darker)
- Increased base opacity from 0.4 to 0.6
- Enhanced animation opacity values for better visibility

### 3. Added Debug Logging
- Added console log when `loading-complete` class is applied
- Helps verify the state transition is working

## Technical Details
The background petals system works as follows:
1. **Page Load**: Petals are hidden (`loading` class, opacity: 0)
2. **Progress 100%**: JavaScript adds `loading-complete` class
3. **Fade In**: Petals fade in with 1.2s transition after 0.8s delay
4. **Animation**: Each petal has individual timing and paths

## Current Status ✅ FIXED
- Background petals should now be clearly visible after loading completes
- Enhanced visibility with larger, darker petals
- Proper state management through loading classes
- Smooth fade-in transition when loading finishes

The background petals are now properly integrated with the loading system and should be visible throughout the site!
