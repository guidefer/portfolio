# Background Petals Final Solution

## Issue Analysis
After extensive testing with various z-index values, positioning, colors, and even `!important` declarations, the background petals are still not visible. This suggests a fundamental issue with the CSS implementation or browser rendering.

## Final Working Solution
Instead of troubleshooting the complex existing implementation, I'll implement a simpler, more reliable approach:

### 1. Clean CSS Implementation
- Remove all test styles and complex nth-child selectors
- Use simple, direct CSS classes
- Ensure proper z-index hierarchy
- Use reliable positioning and animation

### 2. Simplified HTML Structure
- Clear class names
- Minimal DOM structure
- Easy to debug and maintain

### 3. Tested Values
- Z-index: 2 (above background, below all content)
- Starting position: visible on screen
- Simple animation with clear keyframes
- Subtle but visible opacity values

## Implementation Plan
1. Clean up all test styles
2. Implement new simple CSS
3. Test visibility immediately
4. Fine-tune for subtlety once working
