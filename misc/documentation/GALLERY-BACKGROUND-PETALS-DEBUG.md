# Gallery Loading and Background Petals Debug - ✅ RESOLVED

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Gallery Stuck on "Loading projects..." - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Status**: FIXED via pre-initialization approach
- **Solution**: Initialize modules before loading screen starts
- **Result**: Gallery loads immediately after loading completes

### 2. Background Petals Not Visible - ✅ RESOLVED  
- **Status**: FIXED via z-index adjustment
- **Solution**: Changed z-index from 0 to 1 
- **Result**: Petals now visible throughout the site

## Final Implementation
- Pre-initialization approach for reliable module loading
- Proper z-index layering for petal visibility
- Clean, maintainable architecture
- All debug logging cleaned up

Both issues successfully resolved! See GALLERY-BACKGROUND-PETALS-RESOLUTION.md for complete details.
