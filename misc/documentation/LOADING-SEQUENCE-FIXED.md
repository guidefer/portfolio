# Fixed Loading Sequence - Complete Solution

## Root Cause Identified:
The navigation was appearing early because modules (including NavigationController) were being initialized immediately after `loading.start()`, not after the loading sequence completed.

## Complete Fix Applied:

### 1. Loading Controller Timing
- `loading.start()` runs the full sequence:
  - Progress simulation (realistic increments)
  - Asset preloading 
  - Minimum 3 second enjoyment time
  - Only then calls `complete()` which triggers fade

### 2. Module Initialization Moved
- **Before**: Modules initialized immediately after `loading.start()`
- **After**: Modules only initialized in `loading:complete` event handler
- Navigation controller doesn't exist until loading is done

### 3. Proper Event Sequencing
- `loading:start` → Loading screen appears
- `loading.start()` runs full sequence
- `loading:complete` event → Initialize all modules + trigger navigation
- Navigation slides down exactly when fade begins

## Updated Flow:
1. **App starts** → Loading controller created
2. **Loading sequence runs** → 3+ seconds of cherry blossoms + progress
3. **Loading completes** → `loading:complete` event fires
4. **Modules initialize** → Navigation, gallery, mascot created
5. **Navigation appears** → Exactly when loading screen fades
6. **Mascot celebrates** → After everything is ready

## Testing:
- Server: `http://localhost:8001` (fresh server with updated code)
- Check console logs for sequence timing
- Navigation should appear only when progress bar reaches 100%

The navigation appearing at 20-30% progress should now be completely fixed since the NavigationController doesn't even exist until the loading sequence completes!
